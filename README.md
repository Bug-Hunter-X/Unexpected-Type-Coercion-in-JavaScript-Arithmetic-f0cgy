# Unexpected Type Coercion in JavaScript Arithmetic

This example demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript related to type coercion in arithmetic operations.  JavaScript's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected results when adding numbers and strings. 

The `bug.js` file shows the problem. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution illustrating how to handle such scenarios using explicit type checking or conversion.

This is a classic example of unexpected behavior that can be easily avoided with stricter type handling or by using functions designed to perform only numerical arithmetic operations.  Always be aware of JavaScript's type system, especially when performing mathematical operations.
